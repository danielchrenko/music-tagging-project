# AN AUTO-TAGGING BASED APPROACH FOR APPROXIMATING ECHONEST MUSICAL FEATURES

# Abstract

The acquisition of The Echo Nest by Spotify in 2016 marked a significant shift in the landscape of music analysis tools. Previously an open-source beacon in the music technology community, The Echo Nest's algorithm was transformed into a proprietary, closed-source "black box," accessible only through Spotify's Web API. This change severely restricted transparency and hindered the ability of independent developers, researchers, and music enthusiasts to access detailed music analysis and feature extraction tools that were once readily available.
In response to this challenge, we develop an open-source alternative that offers a higher level of simplicity and accessibility. By creating a multiclass classifier model, we aim to approximate the numeric scores of The Echo Nest with descriptive tags for any given audio track. Our model can also give insight into which musical features provide the strongest associations with Echo Nest scores.
Our approach emphasizes interpretability and user-friendliness, making it suitable for a wide range of users from academic researchers to hobbyist music curators. The simplicity of our model makes it easy to be used in practical applications like music discovery, categorization, and recommendation.
